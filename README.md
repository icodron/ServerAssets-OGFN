# Fortnite Server Assets (PS4 Builds)

This repository documents the process of extracting **server assets** from supported **Fortnite PS4 builds**.

Server assets are required for:
- POI Manager
- Proper navigation mesh (NavMesh) functionality
- BotNames
- Maps like Creative hub
- And more

## Supported Versions

⚠️ **Important**

- **PS4 builds from OT 6.5 through 12.61 (Maybe 13.00) include server assets**
- **Builds newer than 12.61 do NOT contain server assets**

This method will not work on versions outside the supported range.

## Prerequisites
- Basic understanding of game asset extraction

### Required Tools
- **PS4PKGViewer**
- **PS4-PKG-Tools**
- **FModel**
-  **u4pak**

## Extraction Guide

### Step 1: Download Fortnite PS4 PKGs

Visit:

https://orbispatches.com/CUSA07022

Use `CTRL + F` to locate the Fortnite version you need  
Example: `12.41`

Download **all PKG files** for that version:
- Typically **9–12 PKG files**
- **Do NOT download delta PKGs**

### Step 2: Merge PKG Files

1. Open **PS4PKGViewer**
2. Merge all downloaded PKGs into a **single PKG file**

> This process may take several minutes.

### Step 3: Extract the Merged PKG

1. Open **PS4-PKG-Tools**
2. Extract the merged PKG file to a directory of your choice
   
Note: if it asks for a password to decrypt use these:

**Fortnite PKG EUR Passcode key:** `4uD7qyfx9TRfRLP7kQTWjxWdh8zb85eY`

**Fortnite PKG US Passcode key:** `ZcR3MhZHd1jeAiX20yR-jmnPEqo-9Pog`

### Step 4: Locate Server Assets and extract them

1. Open **FModel**
2. Add the [AES](https://github.com/dippyshere/fortnite-aes-archive) keys and load the Paks using FModel
3. Browse the content to locate the **server assets**
4. Extract them
5. Use u4pak to pak them (Make a sig file by getting a random sig dile from your builds paks and rename it the same name as your pak)

**For example:**

NavMesh is located at: `FortniteGame/Content/Maps/Apollo_Nav_Gameplay`

Bounds are located at: `FortniteGame/Content/Maps/NavMeshBounds`

POI Manager is located at: `FortniteGame/Content/Athena/Apollo/Maps (Every File)`

BotNames are located at: `FortniteGame/Content/Athena/AI/Phoebe/Names (Every File)`

- Server assets are exclusive to supported PS4 builds (Maybe other console builds)
